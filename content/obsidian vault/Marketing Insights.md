## Story of a clothing business owner
When my friends grandfather started to build his clothing business empire which he built to significant number and divided among their children and son in laws later.

the thing he did while starting out is he used to go the government schools and meet the lecturers in those schools by talking them to buy from his store and pay later when they get the salary in the following months. this is an amazing tack tick to build a customer base when you are just starting out, he did this at the ages of where there is no technology or any source of knowledge to find , he understood that he cant get loyal customers with just selling once who visit once. he personally went to the customers to build loyalty among his customers which ultimately build recurring visits and sure payments from government employs and the as far as i know govt employs sure have connections which also helps in marketing all these were enough to get him started and gain attention for his store and business and build a name for him
